- The plastic we're using for the door buzzer case is called Polymethyl methacrylate, but is more commonly known as acrylic.
- It is a thermoplastic, which means that we can heat it up and bend it into any shape we like.

- The first task is to countersink the back of the door buzzer case.
- Use a countersink-cutter to create the countersinks as shown below.

- Make sure your M3x12 machine screws sit flush to the surface of acrylic.
- Then secure them in place with M3 nuts.

- Now you can secure your soldered board to the back of the case.
- You'll need to use a pair of threaded spacers to secure the board in place.

- Now we need to shape the edge strip of the buzzer, so that if fits around the base.
- To do this we're going to use a line bender.
- The following video will show you how to use the line bender.

- Once the edge strip has been line bent, you can place it around the base of the door buzzer.

- And then secure the top using some more M3 machine screws that will screw into the threaded spacers.

- Take a video of your buzzer working when you press the button.
