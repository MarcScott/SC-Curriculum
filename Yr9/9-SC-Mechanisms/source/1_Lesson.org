- A lever is characterised by a =beam=, which is hinged by a =fulcrum=.

- There are three classes of lever (Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3)
- Use online resources to find out about the three classes of lever and then complete the Silver Badge task.

- Copy and complete the following three sentences.
*** First-class lever
A first-class lever is a lever where the =__________= is in between the effort and resistance (the load). =__________= and  =__________= are examples of first class levers.
*** Second-class lever
A second-class lever is where the resistance is between the =__________= and the =_________=. =___________= and =_________= are examples of second class levers.
*** Third-class lever
A third class lever is where the =__________= is between the resistance and the =___________=. =_________= and =____________= are examples of third class levers.

- You're going to use the Wacano to design and build some levers.
- Use the image below as a guide, and build a First-class lever.

- Using the connectors as beams, your finger as the effort and an elastic band as the resistance, build all three classes of leaver, and use video to evidence them working.

- Levers can amplify an input force to provide a larger output force.
[[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Lever_Principle_3D.png]]
- If you look at the diagram above, the lever is said to be balanced.
- This is because the product of the mass on the left multiplied by it's distance from the fulcrum, is equal to the product of the mass on the right, multiplied by it's distance to the fulcrum.
- The equation (written above the image) allows us to easily calculate output forces for any class of lever. We can change the sybols a little to make it easier to use.
