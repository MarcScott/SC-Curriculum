- In this project you're going to build a desktop-fan, whose speed can be controlled using a component called a potentiometer.
- The circuit uses a GENIE C08 chip to control the fan.
- You've had pleanty of experience of soldering PCBs by now, so minimal guidance has been provided. However, putting together the actual fan takes time, so you are better off starting early.
** Build It

- Here is the board you will be soldering together.
[[file:img/board.jpg]]
- Solder in your components as shown below. *Do not solder on the leads for the motor, power supply or switch*
[[file:img/soldered.jpg]]
- Once you have soldered the board together, you can begin to assemble the case. Use masking tape to hold it together to start, and do not glue it until you are sure you have everything in the correct place.
- Put together part of the case as shown below.
[[file:img/case1.jpg]]
- Next you'll need a motor.
[[file:img/motor1.jpg]]
- Remove the axel and the worm gear (with pliers), and then reverse the motor in it's housing.
[[file:img/motor2.jpg]]
- Now you can position your motor on the back of the case.
[[file:img/case2.jpg]]
- Now you'll want to solder on the leads for the motor, power an switch. Use about 30cm of multi-core wire for the motor and power leads, and about 10cm of wire for the switch. You are advised, however, to try and judge how much wire you will need by placing your PCB in the case and feeding the wire through the holes. Remember, you'll want to twist the wires together as well, which will shorten them.

- Make sure you feed the leads through their respective strain holes.
- Now solder on your switch and cover the joins with heatshrink.

- Take photos of the solder and componenet side of your board, and the leads to your switch. Your badge will be awarded according to the quality of your work.

- Now it is time to test your board.
- Progress to Week 3 where details are provided on testing your board and programming your GENIE chip.
