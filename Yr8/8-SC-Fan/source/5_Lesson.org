- The first thing to do is to assemble to motor mount.
- Look carefully at the image below, and in particular the position of the two small holes through which the board's leads will pass.
- Use a small amount of PVA glue to bond the MDF parts together.
[[file:img/case6.jpg]]
- Next take the base of the case, and use machine screws to fix the board to it as shown below.
[[file:img/case5.jpg]]
- Now you can feed the leads through the motor mount.
[[file:img/case7.jpg]]
- Then use machine screws to mount the motor.

- Solder the leads to the back of the motor, using a little heat shrink to secure them in place.

- Next take a toggle switch and secure it into the hole in the side of the case.

- You can then use some side cutters to cut through one of your power leads. Each end can then be soldered to the toggle switch
file:img/case11.jpg
- Now attach the side to the rest of the case.
file:img/case12.jpg
- Now we can work on the battery clips
- Take two AA battery clips and trim the wires as shown below
file:img/case1.jpg
- Thread on a small amount of heat shrink and twist the wires together
file:img/case2.jpg
- Now solder the wires together.
file:img/case3.jpg
- Use a cable tie to secure the battery clips beneath the motor.
file:img/case13.jpg
- Solder the battery clips leads to your power leads and cover with heat shrink
file:img/case14.jpg
- Then you can add a capacitor to the back of the motor.
file:img/case15.jpg
- Take your line-bent blade from Lesson 4 and push it onto the motor axle.
file:img/case16.jpg
- You can then add the remaining side of your case, and use PVA to glue it all together.

- Take photographs of your fan (without the front cover) from front, side, top and perspective elevations.
- Your badge will be awarded according to the quality of your work.
