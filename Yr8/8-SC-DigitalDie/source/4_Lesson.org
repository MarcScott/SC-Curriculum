- Your initial board should look like this.
[[file:img/1.jpg]]
- You should be able to solder on the first few components without any guidance.
- Start with the smallest components first.
- *Don't solder on the LEDs, battersnap or switch yet.*
- *Make sure the diode and the 7805 voltage regulator are in the correct way around* (or you might give yourself a bit of a suprise).
- Your board should look like this when it is finsihed.

- With the basic components soldered to the board, you now need to add in the LEDs.
- The LEDs need to be on flying wires.
- Follow the guide below *carefully*.
- Take an LED and two 50mm lengths of *multicore* wire.

- Wrap the ends of a wire around the leg of the led (red on the long leg).
file:img/23.jpg
- Now clamp the LED and use a *very small* quantity of solder to bond the wire to the leg.
file:img/24.jpg
- You can now repeat the process with the other leg.
- Next you'll need two small lengths of heatshrink.
- Slide the heatshrink over the solder-join and use the side of your soldering iron to gently heat the tubing.

- Now you can solder the wires onto your PCB, and twist them so they look neat
file:img/31.jpg
- Now just six more LEDs to solder.

- Your switch and battery-snap are soldered in much the same way.
- Don't forget to pass your battery snap through the strain hole as shown below before soldering it on.

- Take a picture of the solder side and component side of your board.
- Take a picture of the flying leads of the LEDs.
- Take a picture of your battery snap and switch.
- Upload your program to your board and make sure it works. Take a *short* video of your board working.
- Your badge will be awarded according to the quality of your work.
