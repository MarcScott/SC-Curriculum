In this project you'll be creating an electronic piano, using an IC called a 555 timer.
** Research It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Use web-based resources to research the following.
- What is meant by the term IC?
- Look up the 555 timer?
  - What does the 555 timer do?
  - What does astable mean?
  - What does monostable mean?
** Record It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: record
:END:
- Use PowerPoint, Word, hand written notes or even HTML to write up your findings so far.
- Include an image of a 555 timer and a brief description of what it does.
** Research It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
- The 555 timer will produce a pulse from the output to the speaker. The frequency of the pulse depends on the resistance of the circuit.
- Conduct some research on sound and what makes a note have a high or low pitch.
** Record It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: record
:END:
- Add your findings to your notes.
- Get your teacher to evidence that you have completed this section
* Design the Circuit
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
** Design It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: design
:END:
- Below is an image of the circuit you are going to be using.
[[file:img/1_lesson/circuit.png]]
- Use Circuit Wizard to replicate the circuit.
  - The 555 Timer can be found under Integrated Circuits
  - The Capacitors can be set to any capacitance you like once you have placed them.
  - The potentiometer's resistance can be altered once you simulate the circuit.
** Record It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: record
:END:
- Add the image of the circuit to your write up.
** Test It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: test
:END:
- In Circuit Wizard, find the Virtual Instruments and then select a Digital Multimeter
- Add it into your circuit as shown below.
[[file:img/1_lesson/multimeter.png]]
- Right click on the multimeter and make sure that it is measuring _ohms_.
- Now hit the play button to simulate your circuit and watch what happens to the resistance when different switches are pushed.
** Record It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: record
:END:
- Add a description of what happens when different switches are pressed to your write-up.
- Get your teacher to evidence that you have completed this section
* Design the PCB

** Design It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: design
:END:
- You're going to have a go at creating a PCB of your circuit.
- Click the button that looks like this [[file:img/1_lesson/button.png]]
- Click Next and then choose _Rats Nest; No Placement or Routing_ and check the box for allowing customisation.
[[file:img/1_lesson/rats.png]]
- Next and Next again
- For each of the PTM switches, you need to make sure you're choosing 10x10 switches. Double click the switch in the list and change it.
[[file:img/1_lesson/PTM.png]]
[[file:img/1_lesson/10x10.png]]
- Now you can click through the remaining menus and convert your circuit to a PCB
- You'll need to try and place the components so that the green connecting wires don't overlap. You might find it's easier to delete the rectangular board to begin with.
- Once you are happy with the placement, try and connect up the components with tracks.
- Here's an example, but try and design your own.

** Record It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: record
:END:
- Add the image of the PCB to your write up.
- Explain any placements that you found tricky to solve.
- Get your teacher to evidence that you have completed this section.
* Building the circuit
- The PCBs you are using have been protected with a silkscreen. This should make the job of soldering them easier to complete.

:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
- Look up the term silkscreen in relation to PCBs and find out what is means.
** Record It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: record
:END:
- Add your findings to your write up
** Build It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: build
:END:
- Below is a picture of a fully assembled PCB. There should also be a demo model available for you to examine.
- Use the images and the circuit design from the previous section, to place and solder your components to the board.
- The components sit on the side with the images.

:END:
- Take pictures as you solder your PCB circuit, to ensure you have a record of the progress you have made.
- Get your teacher to evidence that you have completed this section.
